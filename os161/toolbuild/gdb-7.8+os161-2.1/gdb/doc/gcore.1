.SH NAME
gcore \- Generate a core file of a running program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
gcore [\-o \fIfilename\fR] \fIpid\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Generate a core dump of a running program with process ID \fIpid\fR.
Produced file is equivalent to a kernel produced core file as if the process
crashed (and if \f(CW\*(C`ulimit \-c\*(C'\fR were used to set up an appropriate core dump
limit).  Unlike after a crash, after \fBgcore\fR the program remains
running without any change.
.SH OPTIONS
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-o\fR \fIfilename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o filename"
The optional argument
\&\fIfilename\fR specifies the file name where to put the core dump.
If not specified, the file name defaults to \fIcore.pid\fR,
where \fIpid\fR is the running program process ID.

The full documentation for GDB is maintained as a Texinfo manual.
If the \f(CW\*(C`info\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`gdb\*(C'\fR programs and GDB's Texinfo
documentation are properly installed at your site, the command
